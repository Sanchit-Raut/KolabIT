i need you to make the following changes and fix the following bugs in the website, keep the backend docs in mind. 
1. Post comments
make the share comment icon working properly, it is not working
can not add any comment to the community post, whenever i click on add nothing happens, make adding comments work.
there is no use of join discussion button in that, remove that button
likes are not maintained, after clicking like and reloading webpage, the like is gone completely
after going to user's profile, there is a message button, after clicking it, nothing happens, so make it work, after clicking message, a chatbox should be opened and message shoud be sent to the user and user also must be notified about it. 
remove the endorse button visible at the user profile,


2. Profile changes
on user profile, projects and resources are not fetched from the DB, i want everything fetched from DB, so make the routs and fetch that data from the DB everytime for the user
on edit profile option, give input fields to add all the information about user which is present in the DB and which can be taken by use like semester, year etc.
