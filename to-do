to do

1. in /projects tab, the project status shows open even if the members are full. It always shows open. it should show as closed whenever the status of project is completed, closed, cancelled, or members full.

2. search filters in projects tab is rubbish values, give appropriate values which are Planning, recuriting, active,completed ,closed,cancle. and then it should work.the Allprojects/recuriting slide button is also not functioning, 

3. in /projects tab, if the project status is completed, the joiing option should be disabled

4. while editing project, after selecting closed the webpage is giving error on console

api.ts:62  PUT http://localhost:5000/api/projects/60bf2ceb-6e6d-45f1-8206-c55850e7c903 400 (Bad Request)

5. change search placeholder in explore tab, just keep it as 'search by name'

6. the departments asking on register should be a dropdown list consisting the departments 
Computer Science & Engineering
Computer Engineering
Electronics & Telecommunication

the above dropdown list should be also maintained in profile edit section, there also we should see only these 3 options

7. the profile editing tab is having the skills in dropdown manner, it should be alphabatically arranged as well as it should be a search dropdown (ComboBox) so that it can be efficient.

8. Normalize the project links, even if it is github.com/asadsds, make it as https://github.com/asadsds


_______________________________________

2. search filters in projects tab is rubbish values, give appropriate values which are Planning, recuriting, active,completed ,closed,cancle. 

there should not be a project type dropdown in search filter filter 


3. the search filter in student explore tab has a dropdown for dept, it should have only these values departments 
Computer Science & Engineering
Computer Engineering
Electronics & Telecommunication



______________________________
the project details tab have resources section, i need the actual posted resources in that section for that you have to do

- Show resources linked to this project
- Two options for implementation:
- Add "Add to Project" button on each resource card in /resources page
- there should be all active projects of that user should be visible where he can add that resource 
- Add dropdown button on each resource card: "Add to Project"
- Show list of user's owned/joined projects
- On select: link resource to that project
- In project details: show all linked resources overview with title, type, uploader
- after clicking that resource overview in project details, the user should be redirected to the actual resource shared.


__________________________

1. the profile edit tab, in that section, only respective semesters should be visible in the dropdown, if year is second, semsester visible should be only 3 & 4, if year is third, semester visible should be 5 & 6 and likewise.

2. the experience is being taken in years, instead just write months. dont take years.

3. getting static data error in /projects

these are the badges present in my DB, so i want you to implement the badges, user should be assigned with its badges for all its respective criteria.
after each post, like, resource, project etc. you should check for criteria of the user and if a badge is satifying the criteria, give that badge in achievements tab in dashboard, do notified the user each time he recieves a badge.
all the badges should be visible in achivements tab of the dashboard.

I need you to fix following features and do following tasks

1. currently i am seeing basic info of the student in /explore tab. but skills are the main feature of our website. so the skills of user should be also visible in the card, below the bio of user in the /explore tab as a tag (static pill).
2. in /projects required skills by a project should be listed in the card of each respective project (in a static pill). it should be below the project description and above the owner name. 
3. message button from /profile.[id] wont work, giving error, make it redirect to its chat
page.tsx:143 [v0] Error sending message: TypeError: _lib_api__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_5__.userApi.sendMessage is not a function
    at handleMessage (page.tsx:137:21)
handleMessage	@	page.tsx:143

4. in profle, the resources in resources tab should be clickable and redirect to the specific ones
5. in post resource, order of the DIVs should be first resource type, then resource details, then video/article links,
6. fix footer of landing page, remove all those unimplemented footer tags 
7. remove 'By signing up, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy' from /register & /login
8. clicking community post card on /community wont open its reply, make it work
9. sent/recieved status of last message for each chat in /messages beside the time (for ex. Sent an hour ago, recieved an hour ago for sent and recieved messages respectively)
10. more subjects in /resources/upload (like dsa, programming, etc)
11. clicking project card on /project should also open project details. it is doing nothing
